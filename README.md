Your task is to build a NodeJS powered service to:

- Create an express API service with MySQL as the datasource
- The entire stack needs to be dockerised (Application container and Database container).

## Requirements

- ExpressJS
- ES6 +
- MySQL
- Good code quality
- High Test coverage
- Ideally surprise us!

## Notes

- Feel free to use npm packages to help you achieve a result.
- Use Docker Hub to host your docker files.
- Feel free to document your approach, any shortcomings or improvements that you encountered or had in mind while going through the process. This is not a mandatory requirement but will help us elevate your though process.

## Deliverable

Send us your repository URL. Your code will be reviewed and we'll ask you questions in the issue tracker.

When we pull your code we'll execute the following commands:

```
yarn
yarn docker-test # Runs unit tests inside a Docker container
docker-compose up
```
